title:Cathedral of Saint Sophia
description:The night was still as water. You pushed open the door to the cathedral, the heavy sound echoing through the hall. Moonlight poured through the stained glass windows, climbing up the two bodies in the center of the hall. The knight in white armor had pierced the heart of a bloated monster with his sword, but had lost his own life in the process. For a moment, the monster's massive body trembled before throwing the knight off. It turned its head towards you.
